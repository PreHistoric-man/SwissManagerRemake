Welcome to Swiss Manager Remake V1
This is my first project which i made and didnt just vibe code(I did use google for sum stuff)
1) It only has 4 members so yeah just input 4 for no of players
2) It has only 1 round 
3) It changes points and shows ranking in the form of descending form
4) Added Round Robin for adding 6-10 players(For Only 6,7 players)
What is Round robin?
Round Robin is a tournament format where each participant plays against every other participant an equal number of times. 
Itâ€™s one of the fairest formats for small groups because it ensures that every player has the same opportunity.
